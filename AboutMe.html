        <h3>Hi, thanks for getting to know me!</h3>
        <p>I'm Matthias Lai, a Journalism and New Media and Digital Design student at Fordham Lincoln Center. I'm currently Head Opinions editor for <a href="https://fordhamobserver.com/staff_name/matthias-lai/" target="_blank">The Observer</a>, the student voice of Fordham Lincoln Center, where I periodically write articles as well. I've also written a bit for <a href="https://amendo.com/author/matthias/" target="_blank">Amendo.com</a>, where I spent a semester as an intern. I grew up in Detroit and when I'm not studying at Fordham I live with my family in upstate New York. I love NYC, and I hope to take every opportunity I can to get to know the city better and explore different neighborhoods and cultures that it has to offer!</p>
