                <figcaption>On February 6th, 2023, several high impact earthquakes struck near the border between Turkey and Syria, killing thousands and devastating those coutries. At Fordham Lincoln Center, students formed the Turkish Students Association, or TSA, to fundraise for earthquale victims and raise awareness on campus. We wanted to document what the process for becoming a club was like for TSA, the impact they've had already and what the future holds for them. Nayeli and I interviewed TSA founders and members, contacted Fordham administration and attended fundraiser events held by TSA to get the full picture, and we created this documentary as a result.</figcaption>
